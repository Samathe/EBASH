Today I
needed to do my weekly review, but there
was no internet in our apartment.
So I started thinking hard about where I could do it:
at a shopping mall, but it’s only open until 10 PM,
or in a coffee shop — but then I’d have to buy coffee.
I had already spent a lot of money on food today, so
I didn’t want to spend even more.
After thinking for a while,
I remembered that my
brother's apartment is about 20 minutes away. I decided to just call him, and now I’m doing my weekly review — happily eating watermelon
